        <p class="py">October 18, 2022</p>
        <p>
          This post will tell you the exact Machine Learning Roadmap to start your ML journey. Whether you are a
          beginner or just started, you will get basics to advance level resources for machine learning. Even I have
          followed these resources to gain much knowledge of ML.

        </div>
        <p class="px">Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, the Internet of Things, etc., are now
          changing the world. It will not be wrong to say these branches will be at their peak.
        </p>
        <p class="px">
          Because the amount of data we generate and store every day is growing at an exponential rate. Machine
          Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning help organizations extract value from the troves of data
          they collect, delivering business insights, automating tasks, and advancing system capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="px">
          Before I jump into the roadmap for ML, let me tell you why this roadmap will be a bit different than others.
        </p>
        <p class="px">
          If you want to build your career in AI & ML, you might get lots of challenges and confusion in starting
          because many of us don’t know the right resources and path to follow for machine learning. Some of us may end
          up with highly advanced ML courses and stop the ML journey.
        </p>
        <p class="px">
          But you will get all the resources that cover fundamental concepts to advance level concepts for ML in this
          Machine Learning Roadmap.

          Prerequisites for starting your machine learning journey:
        </p>
        <h1 class="">
          1. Maths
        </h1>
        <p class="py">
          "Mathematics is the heart of Machine Learning"
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          In my opinion, having a fundamental knowledge of maths is a must for starting Machine learning because every
          Machine Learning algorithm is built on mathematical concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a University student, you may already have a basic knowledge of mathematics essential for Machine
          Learning. If you are not, don’t be sad. I will walk you through every mathematical resource you need to be
          cleared before jumping into ML.
        </p>
        <p>Those mathematical topics are given below.
          <li>Linear Algebra</li>
          <li>Probability & Statics</li>
          <li>Calculas</li>
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          Let’s discuss how the above topics are used in Machine Learning and share some helpful resources.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <li type="i">Linear Algebra</li>
        </h1>
        <p class="py">
          Linear Algebra is the branch of Mathematics. We study vectors, matrics, Symmetric Matrices, Orthogonalization
          & Orthonormalization, Matrix Operations, Projections, Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors, Vector Spaces, and Norms in
          Linear Algebra.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          We use these concepts in many ML algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Eigendecomposition of a
          matrix, LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition/Factorization, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), etc.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          I have mentioned some great resources for learning Linear Algebra. If you are a beginner, you can go through
          these resources and learn the fundamental of linear Algebra.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          I prefer you to go through this <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2QY0xcsWhz6ghPUixeNQm47xapSKw4SM"
            alt="This is 3Blue 1Brown" target="_blank">playlist</a>. I didn’t make it…but I think this is best for basic
          algebra. This is made by the 3Blue1Brown channel on youtube.

        <h1>
          ii. Probability & Statistics
        </h1>
        <p>Statistics and Machine learning do not have much difference. In the machine learning process, we need to deal
          with data and its properties most of the time.</p>
        <p class="py">
          We analyze data, learn from data, and gather insights and visualizations that will help build best suit
          algorithms for a given problem or application. This is what statistics is all about.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          Probability and statistics are used in ml theory like Combinatorics, Probability Rules & Axioms, Bayes’
          Theorem, Random Variables, Variance and Expectation, Standard Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial,
          Uniform, and Gaussian), Conditional and Joint Distributions, Moment Generating Functions, Prior and Posterior,
          Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) and Sampling Methods.
        </p>

          I mentioned some excellent resources for Probability & Statistics.

          iii. Calculus
        </h1>
        <p class="py">
          Calculus helps to understand the behavior and internal working different algorithms and function. It would be
          best to learn calculus to know how the function behaves and its changes over time.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          The topis we need to learn in calculus are Differential and Integral Calculus, Partial Derivatives,
          Vector-Values Functions, Directional Gradients, Hessian, Jacobian, Laplacian, and Lagrangian Distribution.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          One of the best calculus applications is the Gradient descent algorithm, which is used in backpropagation in
          neural networks to find the minima of a function.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          I’m attaching the resources for calculus. It’s a playlist on youtube made by 3Blue1Brown. If you are not from
          a mathematical background then I suggest you learn the basics of calculus from this playlist.

          2. Python
        </h1>
        <p class="py">
          To implement ML algorithms, modify them, and perform different tasks, you must choose a programming language.
          I prefer Python programming languages for ML.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          Because Python is popular, easy to learn the language for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In machine learning, you have to train your models with different kinds of data and deal with it. People used
          to do all the tasks manually, like coding algorithms, mathematical formulas, and building models. Compared to
          the past, It is easy to train and make models now because of various python libraries and modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some essential libraries of Python:
          <li>Numpy</li>
          <li>Pandas</li>
          <li>Matplotlib</li>
          <li>Seaborn</li>
          <li>TensorFlow</li>
          <li>Keras</li>
          <li>Scikit-learn</li>
          <li>PyTorch</li>
          <li class="py">CV2</li>
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          If you want to learn python from the beginning, I suggest you learn it from Freecodecamp. He made an amazing
          playlist from beginner to advanced level. I’m not promoting any channels, but I only suggest you the best
          ones.

          It would be best To learn basic concepts of python language and some needed libraries like NumPy, pandas,
          matplotlib, and seaborn first.
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          Let us briefly look at each library:
          <li><b>Numpy:</b>
            In machine learning, you have to play with matrices and vectors so that NumPy will be beneficial. We can use
            many functions to perform mathematical and scientific calculations using NumPy.
          </li>
          <li><b>Pandas:</b>
            To deal with the dataset, pandas will be very helpful. For example, load the data, rearrange data, analyze
            data, understand the data, etc.
          </li>
          <li><b>Matplotlib:</b>
            matplotlib helps visualize the data and results by making graphs and helps to understand data.
          </li>
          <li class="py"><b>Seaborn:</b>
            seaborn is a very similar library to the matplotlib. You can say that seaborn is updated matplotlib. Seaborn
            is also a handy library.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p class="py">
          If you don’t know all these libraries, then I suggest you this Freecodecamp video on youtube.

        <p>
          As you know, machine learning is the study of making machines behave like a human and make decisions and
          predictions for different applications. Having the fundamental knowledge of machine learning algorithms is
          good for you.
